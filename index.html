                <h1>Johnson &amp; Johnson</h1>
                <h3>Application Support Analyst (Contract)</h3>
                <p>
                    One week after earning my Salesforce Admin certification, I was grateful to land a job with Johnson &amp; Johnson
                    as an Application Support Analyst. Technology Services within J&amp;J can be split up into two sectors: BUILD and RUN. I serve on the RUN side.
                    The RUN sector can be split up even further into various clusters with varying technology specialties. The cluster I
                    serve on is called Customer &amp; Sales which specializes primarily in Salesforce technology. Our application portfolio
                    boasts over 30 unique Salesforce instances. Each of these Salesforce applications are owned by a business, and the day-to-day
                    support of these applications is contracted to a 3rd-party vendor (Cognizant for Customer &amp; Sales). Thus, the RUN
                    team serves as a liaison between the owning-business and the vendor.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the support of an application is contracted, I seldomly find myself within a Salesforce instance doing actual support. 
                    However, I am helping triage Incident tickets submitted by the application users through an internal ticketing tool developed by 
                    J&amp;J called IRIS. Thus, my understanding of Salesforce is being applied and growing every day to help mitigate issues. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that broadly covers most of my day-to-day duties, I am also responsible for several long-term projects:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Operations Run Book (ORB): </b>Key documentation for an application includes a Technical Design Specifications (TDS) 
                            and an Operations Run Book (ORB). A TDS is created by the BUILD team during development, and details the entire inner workings
                            of an application. An ORB further details information that may not be covered by a TDS such as points of failures, 
                            impacted user communities, communication and resolution protocols for outages, and comprehensive contact information. 
                            When I came onto the team and started learning about supporting the cluster's applications,
                            I was pointed towards the application's corresponding ORB to learn more about supporting said application. However, we soon
                            realized the overall landscape of our cluster's ORBs was in a poor state. Thus, I was put in charge of an effort 
                            to work with the various support teams to help improve the quality of each application's ORB and bring them to our baseline standards.

                        <li>
                            <b>Aggrify: </b>One of my favorite projects was enabling a service-level targeting tool offered by another RUN team cluster 
                            (Data &amp; Analytics) called Aggrify. This tool captures pertinent metadata about any jobs your application may have. 
                            We enabled this tool specifically for Scheduled Apex classes within our various Salesforce applications. With Aggrify 
                            enabled, we can monitor for job success and failures, analyze the mean time for a job to complete, and troubleshoot 
                            possible solutions to make the job run more efficiently.

                        <li>
                            <b>Knowledge Articles: </b>Whenever a Incident ticket is resolved in IRIS, you are required to find or create an appropriate
                            Knowledge Article that details the steps taken to resolve the issue in order to close the ticket. Over-time you build a strong
                            Knowledge Base, and steps to resolve repeated issues can be found easily. However, over-time we have found that the vendor
                            has cut corners, and they create lazy Knowledge Articles that have no sustenance whatsoever, and only pollute the Knowledge Base.
                            To help mitigate this issue, our cluster created an audit process to randomly select various Knowledge Articles created in the prior
                            month and verify the quality of their content. If a Knowledge Article does not meet the baseline standards, we provide feedback
                            to the original author and they are to update it appropriately. 
                        </li>

                            which allow you to backup salesforce data and metadata, and restore it to any environment. So, should an application 
                            have a major release go awry, you can restore a production environment to a previous stable state with clean data. 
                            We have started integrating our portfolio of applications with CopyStorm since mid 2019. While this service is 
                            primarily supported by our vendor (Cognizant), a co-worker and I have been involved in the process as an learning
                            experience.

                <p>
                    While attending college at University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee, I was fortunate enough
                    to intern part-time as a Junior Developer at Franco Signor LLC. The company operates within the

                    <p>
                        I list my Salesforce experience gained while working at Franco Signor first because it was the first time I was 
                        exposed to the platform. However, I consumed Salesforce more as an end user than a developer or admin.
                        Most of my experience was mores so in interacting with the Salesforce API, and as laid out in my experience 
                        section for Franco Signor: Programming SSIS packages that query client data using SQL which is then 
                        transformed and imported into the appropriate Salesforce objects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As time carried on, Franco Signor began leveraging the power of Salesforce more and more. Utilizing features 
                        such as workflow rules, process builders, and flows. While I poked around a little and inspected what they
                        were doing, I had not built any of this functionality. In fact, it was all done by one business analyst,
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-weber-76500553/"> Brandon Webber</a>,
                        who eventually went on to become a Sr. Associate with PricewaterhouseCoopers thanks to his experience learning Salesforce.
                        So, as my graduation date neared and I began pondering what my career path may look like; Brandon had encouraged me 
                        to look into Salesforce.

                <h3>Profile: <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/me/matthewdoles">Matthew Doles</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Like any earnest Salesforce Developer, my journey truly took off when I became an official Trailblazer which was in May of 2018.
                    I had previously done some Trailhead here and there prior, but this is truly when I started dedicating hours to learn 
                    Salesforce. After a few months and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/salesforce-administrator/">Mike Wheeler's great Admin Course</a>
                    , I had became a Salesforce Certified Administrator. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in my experience section for Johnson &amp; Johnson, I had landed a job on contract there thanks to my new
                    certification. So, while I was getting acquainted with my new role, my Trailhead journey took a small pause. 
                    However, the quest for more certifications came back with a force in late December of 2018 when I began prepping for 
                    the Platform App Builder exam by using Trailhead and yet another great 
                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-platform-app-builder/">Mike Wheeler course for Platform App Builder</a>.
                    In fact, I had attempted and passed the exam on Christmas Eve which had made for an extra enjoyable holiday season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I was still not done. I quickly turned around and dedicated myself to earning the Platform Developer I certification. This is
                    when I truly leaned in on Trailhead as I worked my way through their official 
                    <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-i-credential">
                    Platform Developer I Trail</a>. With only a little over a month of elapsed time since I had passed my previous exam, 
                    I attempted and passed the Platform Developer I exam. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point of time, I had become close to Ranger status. So as I made that push, I took a shining to the Superbadges as they provide
                    real-world scenarios instead of just walking you through a simple project. My favorite Superbadge in particular has been the
                    Aura Component Specialist. In the following months after passing the Platform Developer I exam, I began learning Aura Components
                    (for reasons as specified in the next section). However, Lighting Web Components seems to be the new trend. Luckily,
                    Trailhead is also great at introducing their new emerging technologies like Lighting Web Components and SalesforceDX. 
                    Consuming the <a href="https://github.com/trailheadapps/lwc-recipes">LWC Recipes</a> has also been influential in this regard. 
                    Furthermore, I have put this knowledge to practice by utilizing Visual Code and SFDX whenever I can to do Trailhead exercise which you can
                    find in the following repository:

                <p>
                    Although I do not do much developer work in my role as an Application Support Analyst. Opportunities have arose to work
                    with the Salesforce BUILD team on the side which is what quickly motivated me to pursue my Platform App Builder and
                    Platform Developer I certifications. With those in hand, I could start getting my feet wet at as a developer on a enterprise level. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To date, I have only worked on a couple projects. The first one being a Proof of Concept (POC) project called 
                    Business Technology Leaders (BTL) Interaction Manager. BTL's within J&amp;J are pretty high up on the totem pole, these
                    individuals determine what applications are going to built, what technology is going to be used to built them, what
                    resources do we have to build them, etc. In a sense, they are the decision makers. This BTL Interaction Manager PoC was
                    built to demo how Salesforce could help capture some of those high-level conversation and put pen to paper. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, my major contribution was building an Aura Component which helps the BTLs navigate the various 
                    Product Catalogs and their corresponding Capabilities. Product Catalogs and Capabilities are both custom objects.
                    The two objects are also in a master-detail relationship with Product Catalog being the master. Capabilities also 
                    has a parent-child relationship with itself. However, only Capabilities marked with the 'IsParent' flag 
                    can be related to a Product Catalog. This to help prevent a Capability with a parent Capability from being added to a
                    Product Catalog. As you can begin to see, this can be rather layered. Thus, the Aura Component I built nicely
                    displays a tree view of this hierarchy for the BTL to browse. The Aura Component also allows you to view existing
                    projects and implementations (Assets object) for each Capability. Then, if the Capability is something that fits
                    your need, you can add it directly to your project (Opportunity object).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second project I have worked on was a Visualforce to Lightning conversion/exercise. The Salesforce BUILD Team for
                    J&amp;J have built an internal management tool (Salesforce instance) which helps them track demand, projects,
                    resources, etc. Projects (Opportunity standard object) have related resources (Opportunity Resources custom object) which
                    need to be filled by various employees (Contact standard object). When the application was built, a Visualforce page was
                    developed to manage this interaction of assigning contacts to a project role (Opportunity Resource) for a project
                    (Opportunity). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Visualforce page was called Opportunity Resource Management, and while the Visualforce page got the job done -
                    it was in need of a makeover. Thus, my role was to modernize and convert this Visualforce page 
                    into an Aura Component(s). The functionality largely remains the same, but the presentation and intuitiveness 
                    was made a bit more user friendly. The new Opportunity Resource Management piece can be broken down into 4 
                    separate components that interact with one another:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           <b>Search: </b>The top most component in the layout is the search component. This component allows you to
                            search for potential resources (Contacts) to fill your project roles. There are three filters: name,
                            role, and technology skill. The name filter is a text field which allows you to search the name
                            fields on both the Account and Contact object through a SOSL query. The role and technology skill are
                            both drop down lists with defined picklist values which are queried for using Apex. When a user provides filters,
                            they can then click the 'Search' button and an event is fired to start communicating with the below 
                            Potential Resources component. 
                        </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>
                            <b>Potential Resources: </b>This component is located directly below the previous Search component, but is 
                            only rendered upon searching. The Search component does an Apex call-out to query for
                            for matching data based on the given filters, and then the Potential Resources component renders that data into a 
                            formatted datatable. With this datatable rendered, you can begin to add a contact to your project by selecting the
                            far right 'View' button which will fire an event to start communicating with the Add/Edit Resource component. 
                        </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>
                            <b>Add/Edit Resource: </b>This component is located directly below the previous Potential Resources
                            component, and is also only rendered upon selecting an individual resource. The Potential Resources component
                            sends the Contact Id to the Add/Edit Resource component, and then the Add/Edit Resource does an Apex call-out
                            to gather more of the Contact's record details. The primary details being queried for are the Contact's current
                            allocations. An allocation being a percentage of the Contact's time needed for a particular project. So, 
                            this component will show you all of the allocations the contact is currently allocated to in between your
                            project's start and end date. If you are comfortable adding the resource to your project without
                            overextending them, you can assign them an allocation yourself and click the 'Add Resource' button.
                        </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>
                            <b>Current Resources: </b>This component is located directly below all the previous components. However,
                            this component will render on page load. It is also important to note that when a project moves into 
                            the 'In Progress' stage, a process builder kicks off which creates mandatory project roles. Thus, this
                            component is a list of all currently allocated resources, and mandatory resources that are yet to be filled.
                            So, when you are adding a resources as described in the previous Add/Edit Resources section, if the contact
                            is filling a mandatory role that is empty, it will do an update operation instead of an insert. However, you
                            can also have multiple resources of the same role type. For instance, few projects will have just one developer. So, when
                            adding a second, third, fourth, etc. developer to a project, it will do an insert operation given that the pre-existing developer role
                            is already filled. You can also edit any resources current allocation for a project by clicking on the 'Edit' button on the resource's 
                            corresponding row on the datatable. Upon doing so, an event is fired which is received by the Add/Edit Resource
                            component (hence the name). There you can edit a resource's allocation, change their project role, or even add
                            them to a second project role. 
                        </li>

                <h1>Whose Tagline is it Anyway</h1>
                <h3>Alexa Custom Skill</h3> 
                <p>
                    One week I was doing some Trailhead, and a certain Trail caught my eye: 
                    <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/innovate-with-alexa-and-amazon-web-services">
                    Innovate with Alexa and Amazon Web</a>Services. The idea of building custom Alexa skills intrigued me. 
                    I completed a few of the Trailhead modules, but I had a taste for more. So I went to Udemy and bought 
                    an Alexa development course by Vivek Kapoor called
                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/build-your-rad-personal-assistant-with-amazon-alexa-custom-skills/">
                    Practical Hands-on Guide for Amazon Alexa Skill Development</a>. This course provided me the fundamentals I needed
                    to start building custom Alexa Skills from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing the course, the first Alexa skill I built was <a href="https://github.com/matthewdoles/alfred-alexa-skill">
                    Alfred</a> which is my own personal voice voice assistant. One of the highlights of Alfred I developed was the ability 
                    for it to read my latest tweet out loud by leveraging <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter">Twitter for Node.js</a>
                    to retrieve and read my latest tweet. Furthermore, I've added logic to customize Alfred's response based upon the 
                    number of times the tweet was favorited. This particular experiment consuming the Twitter API is then what 
                    inspired me to create Whose Tagline Is It Anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whose Tagline Is It Anyway is a movie trivia Alexa skill with two games. In the primary self-titled game
                    (Whose Tagline Is It Anyway), you must guess which movie a random movie tagline belongs to from a pool of
                    over 1,500+ popular movies. The second game is called Good Word Hunting. At the start of the game you are given up
                    to 7 keywords that describe a movie from the same pool of 1,500+ popular movies. With those keywords, you must
                    reply with how many names from lowest to highest billed you would need to guess what the movie may be. After
                    being given the requested number of names, you then submit your guess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To develop Whose Tagline Is It Anyway I used the standard Alexa Skills Kit to design the voice interaction, and
                    developed a Lambda function to handle the intent invocation as defined in my voice interaction. The runtime language
                    of my Lambda function is Node.js. As for retrieving movie information, I am doing HTTP requests to 
                    <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database (TMDb)</a> which offers a free public API. 
                    TMBb has almost half a million of movies cataloged. Luckily, in the GET request I can define parameters, 
                    like the number of times the movie was rated, to limit the pool of queried movies. However, if you wanted 
                    to get the movie tagline or movie cast for a specific movie, voice intents are available for the user to do so.
                 </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the Good Word Hunting game is an entitlement. Meaning that you pay a one time fee ($1) to own the right
                    to play the game. Configuring this option was easily the hardest part of the project. When you start asking
                    the user to pay money, the Amazon Alexa skill team will thoroughly test that your skill works as intended and 
                    everything is working as intended. Wile it took a few times to make my skill compliant, I found satisfaction
                    in the revision process and working towards a nice polished product. While the monetary transaction is handled by 
                    Amazon themselves, much code configuration was needed to ensure that the user wasn't able to access Good Word Hunting,
                    and then the opposite after the user purchases the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Whose Tagline is it Anyway is a monetary property of mine, the repository is private. However, if you would like to 
                    peruse some similar code, I would direct you to Alfred: <a href="https://github.com/matthewdoles/alfred-alexa-skill">

                <h1>Hopped Up Network</h1>
                <h3>Website for Craft Beer-Centric Podcasting Network</h3>
                <p>
                   I started developing the website for the Hopped Up Network in late 2017 as my senior project for USFSM. The original
                   co-founder of the network, Mathew Muncy, was a mutual friend of mine through my brother. Muncy is a journalist, podcaster,
                   and content creator who has worked in the craft beer industry much of his career. Muncy had built a small following for his
                   podcast, <a href="http://barrelchatpodcast.com/">Barrel Chat</a>, and wanted to build a network platform for similar 
                   beer-centric podcasts that would offer cross-promotion and build a community of like-minded beer lovers. 
                </p>  
                <p>
                    At the time, Muncy was using WordPress to host all the network's podcasts. While it got the job, Muncy was not satisfied
                    with its point and click WYSIWYG features. If the platform were to grow, he needed a more polished product that could also
                    scale with growth. With the business goal and needs established, I began developing the website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and
                    PHP. It was my first major project that I developed from scratch, and I really had no sense of web design concepts compared to
                    what I know now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overall design of the website is pretty straightforward. A home page that displays the 10 most recent episode across allocated
                    podcasts. An about us page that explores the network's beginning, purpose, founders, and instructions on how to join. A podcasts page
                    which listed all the podcasts on the network available for listen. Additionally, every show has its own page that contains a feed of
                    their episodes available for listen, and an audio player to listen directly on the website. Finally, there was a contact page which 
                    was a simple form anyone could fill out that would send a message to the network's email address. The only other major feature was the 
                    search functionality. Located in the upper right hand corner is a search bar. Typing in any keywords will look for any matching phrases
                    within an episode's description or title and highlight them with bold font.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project had a couple major barriers I had to climb. The first one was setting up a MySQL database to host all the podcast information.
                    The tricky part here was that we did not want to host the audio files on our website as that can get expensive rather quickly.
                    Thus, I had to create a Cron job that would go through each individual podcast RSS feed, insert any new episodes, and save the url 
                    address where the audio file was being hosted. This way, all I have to do is dynamically assign the URL address to the audio player.
                    While in hindsight, this would now be a rather simple ask for me. The learning curve in junction with PHP being so new to me is what 
                    made it difficult. The second major challenge presented to me was making the website web responsive and intuitive on mobile phones. 
                    Muncy had noticed thanks to Google Analytics that over 50% of the site's traffic was from mobile users. Thus, the website needed to
                    render in a mobile friendly format. I accomplished this through CSS media queries. Although it was still the same website, 
                    the whole venture felt like an entirely new project, and I'm thankful as it forced me to become familiar with CSS and web 
                    responsiveness concepts. I have even made this very website as mobile friendly as possible thanks to CSS media queries. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muncy and his partner, Dustin Woods, would go on to sell Hopped Up Network, and continue focusing on their own podcast:
                    <a href="http://barrelchatpodcast.com/">Barrel Chat</a>. Although Hopped Up Network is still active, I eventually rolled off the
                    project myself to focus on my own search for a job. The website design is still the same, but I respectfully have not made the
                    code available for public viewing.

                <h3><b>Honors:</b> 3.8 GPA - Magna Cum Laude</h3>
                <p>
                    I initially started my undergraduate education at <a href="https://franklincollege.edu/">Franklin College</a> 
                    in Fall of 2012 as a Computer Science major. Franklin College is located in Indiana, and Franklin itself is the 
                    small town just South of Indianapolis I grew up in. However, after two years I transferred to the 
                    <a href="http://usfsm.edu/">University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee</a> in Fall of 2015 in order to be 
                    closer to my parents that had moved to the area themselves a year prior. Unfortunately, they did not have a 
                    Computer Science major. However, the program still offered me the education and tools needed to pursue a career 
                    path in the general IT field. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only downside is I wanted to pursue a career path in development or engineering. Having graduated in Spring of 2018, 
                    I spent the majority of that summer looking for a job, and when I wasn't doing that I was learning, coding, and filling 
                    in the missing gaps so I could land a job as a developer. Luckily when it rains it pours, and during a one week span in 
                    late August I was offered three jobs. One as a PHP developer, the second as an intern to full-time C#/.NET developer,
                    and the final one being the Application Support Analyst with J&amp;J which is the role I presently hold. While this current position
                    is not in development, I could not pass up on the chance to work with such a great company and potentially work my way 
                    towards a developer role.
